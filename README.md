## ❓ General

For the 2024 Hoya Hacks hackathon, we built a security advice chatbot as demonstration of a highly scalable method to increase digital literacy among the general population.

🏆 We won the CloudFlare track!

## ⚙️ Tech used

- CloudFlare Workers AI
- MongoDB App Services Authentication
- MongoDB database (persistant chats)
- Next.js/React.js

## 📝 Notes

3/4 members of the team had little to no front-end/JavaScript experience, so this was really exciting and enriching.

Huge thanks to the organizers, sponsors, and our fellow hackers for a wonderful experience.
